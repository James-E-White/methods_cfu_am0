# 1: In the Ruby Docs for String methods (https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.1.0/String.html), find 4 methods you have not yet used and call them on one of the variables above. Between reading the documentation and reading the output from calling the methods, make sense of what they do.
  # Write the methods out on the lines below, with an explanation in your own words of how they work.
