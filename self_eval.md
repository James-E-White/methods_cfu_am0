How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?I am getting there. the practice in groups helped today.
How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own? Not overly confident but have time set aside tomorrow to play around with them
What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!) Can you update methods at any time or should you start the string over?
